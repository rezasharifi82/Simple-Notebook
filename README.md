# Text Editor
### Programming Language: 
      Python(3.10)
   -------
This is a simple text editor which can modify text file using python.   
    First of all you need to know some essential things about how this program works:   
  1.  When you run the code, you should enter one of the main functions that've been defined.   
  2.  There is a main loop which run while you use the program so if you want to break it you can exit easily.   
  3.  **List of all functions:**     
  > **Exit**   
  > **Next page**   
  > **Previous page**   
  > **Where**    
  > **Show(n)**   
  > **Append**   
  > **Insert(text,line number)**   
  > **Remove(n)**   
  > **Replace( a , n )**   
  > **Swap( a , b )**  
  > **Find(a)**  
  > **Find&Replace ( a , b )**  
  > **Undo**  
  > **Redo**  
  
  
Actually, It's like vim. You should work with commands.
